- 👋 Hi, I’m @Bizarkus
- 👀 I’m interested in starting a life in coding/engineering from the beginning.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning python and the daily life of a coder
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on the basic building blocks of code, "learning the scales" through repetition and practice.
- 📫 You can reach me via bizarkusproductions@gmail.com 
- If you'd like to see some irrelevant content, I stream Dungeons and Dragons games on twitch & youtube @Bizarkus!
